On line 92 we note that this variable is what’s being read as the user input for when the “API key” is requested. This is a string format vulnerability we can attempt to exploit.If we connect to the server again and input multiple %X characters at that prompt, we’ll get the server to print data from the stack in hex:What would you like to do?1) Buy some stonks!2) View my portfolio1Using patented AI algorithms to buy stonksStonks chosenWhat is your API token?%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%XBuying stonks with token:88494F0804B00080489C3F7F48D80FFFFFFFF18847160F7F56110F7F48DC708848180388494D088494F06F6369707B465443306C5F49345F74356D5F6C6C306D5F795F79336E6263376365616336FFDB007DF7F83AF8F7F56440424F380010F7DE5BE9F7F570C0F7F485C0F7F48000FFDB8D88F7DD658DF7F485C08048ECAFFDB8D940Converting the hex to text:$ echo &quot;88494F0804B00080489C3F7F48D80FFFFFFFF18847160F7F56110F7F48DC708848180388494D088494F06F6369707B465443306C5F49345F74356D5F6C6C306D5F795F79336E6263376365616336FFDB007DF7F83AF8F7F56440424F380010F7DE5BE9F7F570C0F7F485C0F7F48000FFDB8D88F7DD658DF7F485C08048ECAFFDB8D940&quot; | xxd -p -rIH?HGVHpHIocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3nbc7ceac6}:d@BO8[pۍeH@%We can spot something that looks like the flag, albeit scrambled.

Then, a bitwise left shift operation by 8 bits ( &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8 ) is performed.The Unicode code of the second character gets added to this value:+ ord(flag[i + 1])which is finally converted back to a character through chr().In sum, we can think of this as every two characters of the flag being encoded into a single character in the enc string.So by doing the inverse of the first operation – shifting the Unicode value of our first encoded character 8 bits to the right – we get the following:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; chr(ord(&#39;灩&#39;) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8)&#39;p&#39;Knowing that the flag follows the format picoCTF{FLAG} , it looks like we’re on the right track.As for the second operation, subtracting the first decoded character, left shifted by eight bits, from the encoded character should give us the second decoded character:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; chr(ord(&#39;灩&#39;) - (ord(&#39;p&#39;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8))&#39;i&#39;Repeating these steps for all the characters in the encoded string gives us:enc = &#39;灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弲㘶㠴挲ぽ&#39;flag = &#39;&#39;for i in range(len(enc)): flag += chr(ord(enc[i]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 8) flag += chr(ord(enc[i]) - (ord(flag[-1]) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8))print(flag)# output: picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_26684c20}And that’s how you reverse engineer the encoding.In-depth ExplanationThe Python snippet used to encode the flag is essentially an algorithm for encoding Unicode UTF-8 (the default encoding) strings into UTF-16 (Big Endian).Like the flag itself hints at (16_bits_inst34d_of_8). An a posteriori hint, if you will.We can see what’s happening under the hood by printing a character’s value in binary:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bin(ord(&#39;p&#39;))&#39;0b1110000&#39;Left-shifted by 8 bits:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bin(ord(&#39;p&#39;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8)&#39;0b111000000000000&#39;Plus the value of the next character:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bin((ord(&#39;p&#39;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8) + ord(&#39;i&#39;))&#39;0b111000001101001&#39;So we can think of left-shifting as padding the letter “p” with 8 empty bits, which are then filled by the second letter in the flag, and so forth for all characters. This is why right-shifting by 8 bits gives us the original first character (since we remove the padding being filled by the second character), and the logic for the rest of the reverse engineering follows from there. Subtracting the value of &#39;ord(&#39;p&#39;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 8&#39; zeroes out the leading 8 bits and we’re left with “i”.Since the default encoding is UTF-8 and the enc string is UTF-16, the characters are rendered incorrectly (as multiple kanji).Therefore, an alternate way to solve this challenge is to simply:Alternate SolutionEncode the enc string in UTF-16BE:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &#39;灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弲㘶㠴挲ぽ&#39;.encode(&#39;utf-16be&#39;)b&#39;picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_26684c20}&#39;" }, { "title": "hello world", "url": "/posts/hello-world/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2021-11-28 00:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Hello worldThis is a testTo see how the blog rendersThis is a list: first second thirdThis is a code snippet: def hello(): array = [1,2,3,4,5] for x in array: print(f&quot;Hello world number {x}&quot;)" } ]
